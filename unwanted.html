            Children will learn to use the computer to find and analyze problems. They will not be afraid of difficult to split tasks, and finally solve the problem further. From conditionals, loops, lists to functions, these real computer concepts will step into children's curious minds.
            The whole course will solve and split different problems, collaborate with each other, and learn things that cannot be learned outside the classroom. The collaborative project at the end of the course is to teach children to create their own personal project with full of sense of accomplishment and fun!                </p>
